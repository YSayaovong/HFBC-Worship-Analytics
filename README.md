## 📚 Case Study: Song Rotation Imbalance & Worship Engagement Decline

### ✅ Scenario
A church notices a decline in worship engagement over several months.  
Team members report:
- The congregation is less responsive during services
- New songs feel “overwhelming”
- Old favorites are being repeated too often
- Planning feels inconsistent between team members

The worship pastor wants data, not opinions, to understand what’s going on.

Your **Worship Analytics Dashboard** is used to analyze the last 18 months of setlists.

### ✅ Step 1 — Data Analysis & KPI Review

After loading historical setlists into the dashboard, the following insights emerge:

**Key Findings**
- Three songs account for **42%** of all rotations  
- Average rotation gap (time before repeating a song) is **10–14 days**, far below the desired 30–45 days  
- Seasonal songs were used inconsistently (e.g., Easter songs appearing in June)  
- Only **17%** of the total song library has been used in the last 6 months  
- Weekend vs. midweek services showed major inconsistency in song variety  

The dashboard highlights:
- Frequency spikes  
- Underused songs  
- Rotation patterns  
- Overlap between service types

### ✅ Step 2 — Identifying the Root Problem

After reviewing trends and heatmaps:

**Root Causes Identified**
1. **Setlists were being planned in isolation**, with no shared historical view  
2. New songs were added too rapidly, causing burnout  
3. High-energy songs were overused, while reflective songs were underused  
4. Song leaders defaulted to personal favorites rather than rotation guidelines  

This explains why the congregation felt the “same songs every week” while the team felt like they were introducing too many new songs.

### ✅ Step 3 — Actionable Recommendations

Based on the analytics, the dashboard recommends:

- Implementing a **minimum 30-day rotation rule** for high-frequency songs  
- Reintroducing **20 underused songs** that still fit the ministry style  
- Creating seasonal song buckets to prevent off-season scheduling  
- Reducing new song introductions from 4 per month to **1–2 per month**  
- Using the dashboard weekly to verify rotation gaps before planning

### ✅ Step 4 — Outcome After 6 Weeks

After adopting a data-informed planning process:

- Congregational engagement visibly improved  
- Overused songs dropped from 42% → **22%** of total rotations  
- Underused songs increased by **31%**  
- New songs were introduced more smoothly, with better congregational retention  
- Team members became aligned because everyone was using the same analytics  

Leaders reported “the most balanced setlists we’ve had all year.”
