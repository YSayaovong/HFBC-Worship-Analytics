# Worship Analytics Dashboard -- Song Usage, Trends & KPI Tracking

## Overview

This project analyzes worship song usage, rotation patterns, and
ministry KPIs across historical setlists. It transforms raw planning
data into clean datasets and delivers insights through clear
visualizations and summary metrics.

## Business Need

Church worship teams often repeat songs without realizing how heavily
certain titles are used. This leads to limited variety, lower
engagement, and difficulty planning balanced setlists. Leaders need
data-driven visibility into: - Song frequency and rotation gaps\
- Overused or underutilized songs\
- Setlist patterns by month, season, or service\
- KPI trends that impact planning and team coordination

This dashboard solves that gap by turning raw setlists into actionable
analytics.
